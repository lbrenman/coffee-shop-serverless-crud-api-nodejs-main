# Coffee API

[Serverless](https://serverless.com/) CRUD REST API to DynamoDB using the Serverless Framework for AWS, Node.js lambda, and GitHub Actions for DevOps.

Based on an excellent [**blog post**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-serverless-crud-rest-api/) by Ifeanyi Otuonye.

I added API Key Auth to the APIs.
